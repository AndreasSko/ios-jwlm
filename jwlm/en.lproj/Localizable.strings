Instead of asking you how to continue, you can decide to always choose one side instead of the other one. For Notes it's also possible to always choose the newer one. This might come in handy, if you are SURE that one side is always the one to include.\n\nThe safest path - especially when merging for the first time - is to leave it at `manual` and decide for each case, which entry should be included into the final backup.";

A collision happens, if two bookmarks are placed at the same slot for the same publication. Choose the bookmark that should be included in the merged backup. The upper one belongs to the right backup, the lower one to the left.\n\n
To figure out, to which publication this Bookmark belongs to, look at the additional information: ‚ÄûBookNumber‚Äú and ‚ÄûChapterNumber‚Äú generally relate to a Bible book, while ‚ÄûDocumentID‚Äú might be a Watchtower issue or a different publication.";

You can think of identifier as paragraphs in a extended way: In bible books thery generally correlate to the verses, however in other publications, questions and captions are also counted towards identifiers. Start- and Endtoken represent the beginning and the end of a marking, where words and punctuation marks are counted as tokens (e.g. the sentence ‚ÄúYou are my witnesses,‚Äù contains five tokens, as four words and one comma are counted). Note that a marking can span multiple Paragraphs. Choose the marking that should be included in the merged backup. The upper one belongs to the right backup, the lower one to the left.\n\n
To figure out where the marking is located, look at the additional information: ‚ÄûBookNumber‚Äú and ‚ÄûChapterNumber‚Äú generally relate to a Bible book, while ‚ÄûDocumentID‚Äú might be a Watchtower issue or a different publication.";

This helps to surface problems that others might face as well. For this, a third-party service called \"Sentry.io\" is used. The data collected does not contain personally identifiable information, but rather information like your operating system and the error message you received. None of your backups will be sent, however an error report might contain snippets like a marking or a note that was processed when you encountered the bug. The data is only used to improve the app.\nThe automatic report is disabled by default. If you feel confident sharing a bug report with me, you can enable it with the following toggle.";

I would really appreciate it if you could send me a bug report with the error below at jwlm@andreas-sk.de. Usually, it's beneficial for me to have a look at the actual backups you tried to merge. So if you feel confident with it, please feel free to provide them with the bug report - of course, I'm only looking at the specific issue and leave the rest of the data untouched.
Thank you so much for your help! üòä";

Please note that playlists won't be included in the merged backup. If you want to keep them, export your playlists via the Share feature in JW Library first and import them again after you restored the merged backup.
Merging playlists is a feature that I'm currently working on and will be included in a later version of Library Merger. Thank you for your patience üòä";
