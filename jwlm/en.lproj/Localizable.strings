Instead of asking you how to continue, you can decide to always choose one side instead of the other one. For Notes it's also possible to always choose the newer one. This might come in handy, if you are SURE that one side is always the one to include.\n\nThe safest path - especially when merging for the first time - is to leave it at `manual` and decide for each case, which entry should be included into the final backup.";

A collision happens, if two bookmarks are placed at the same slot for the same publication. Choose the bookmark that should be included in the merged backup. The upper one belongs to the right backup, the lower one to the left.\n\n
To figure out, to which publication this Bookmark belongs to, look at the additional information: „BookNumber“ and „ChapterNumber“ generally relate to a Bible book, while „DocumentID“ might be a Watchtower issue or a different publication.";

The two latter ones represent the beginning and the end of a marking, where words and punctuation marks are counted as tokens (e.g. the sentence “You are my witnesses,” contains eight
tokens, as three words, three whitespaces and one comma are counted). Note that a marking can span multiple Paragraphs. Choose the marking that should be included in the merged backup. The upper one belongs to the right backup, the lower one to the left.\n\n
